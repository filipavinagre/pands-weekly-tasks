# Program 1: Reads in a 10 charater account number and outputs the account number with only the last 4 digits showing.

# Prompt user for 10 digit account number
account_number = input("Please enter an 10 digit account number: ")

# Outputs the 10 character account number with only the last 4 digits showing.

# Program 2: Reads in an account number, regardless of itÂ´s lenght and outputs the account number with only the last 4 digits showing.

# Prompt user for account number
